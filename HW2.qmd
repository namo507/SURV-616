## 1. [5 points] A researcher who wants to study the predictors of lung cancer draws a sample of persons with lung cancer from a database of lung cancer patients and a sample of persons without lung cancer from the general population. Is this a prospective or retrospective study?

I think this is a retrospective study. 
Now from the class lecture, in a retrospective study, researchers look back in time to examine data or events that have already occurred. So in this scenario, the researcher is selecting a group of individuals who already have lung cancer (cases) and comparing them to a group of individuals without lung cancer (controls). Simply the goal here is to investigate potential predictors or risk factors by analyzing past exposures or characteristics in these two groups.

So the key aspect to be pointed here is that the researcher is not following participants over time to see who develops lung cancer (which in turn would make it a prospective study). Instead, they are starting with an outcome (lung cancer) that has already happened and working backward to identify possible causes or predictors. This backward-looking approach in the question mentioned is what defines a retrospective study.
