## 1. [5 points] A researcher who wants to study the predictors of lung cancer draws a sample of persons with lung cancer from a database of lung cancer patients and a sample of persons without lung cancer from the general population. Is this a prospective or retrospective study?

I think this is a retrospective study. 
Now from the class lecture, in a retrospective study, researchers look back in time to examine data or events that have already occurred. So in this scenario, the researcher is selecting a group of individuals who already have lung cancer (cases) and comparing them to a group of individuals without lung cancer (controls). Simply the goal here is to investigate potential predictors or risk factors by analyzing past exposures or characteristics in these two groups.

So the key aspect to be pointed here is that the researcher is not following participants over time to see who develops lung cancer (which in turn would make it a prospective study). Instead, they are starting with an outcome (lung cancer) that has already happened and working backward to identify possible causes or predictors. This backward-looking approach in the question mentioned is what defines a retrospective study.


## 2. [5 Points] A researcher who wants to study the impact of Vitamin D on children’s health draws a sample of children, randomly splits them into two groups and gives one group Vitamin D and the other group a placebo. Is this a prospective or retrospective study?

I believe this is a prospective study.
In this scenario, the researcher is starting with a group of children who are initially healthy and then actively intervening by giving one group Vitamin D and the other group a placebo. The researcher will follow these groups over time to observe how their health outcomes differ. This forward-looking approach i.e. starting from the intervention and moving forward to measure its effects, is characteristic of a prospective study as discussed in the lecture.

Also I would like to point out that what makes it even clearer is that the study involves randomization, which is a hallmark of experimental designs like randomized controlled trials. These types of studies are inherently prospective because they track participants into the future to assess the impact of the intervention. So in this case, Vitamin D on specific outcomes i.e. children’s health. So, I’m confident this would be classified as a prospective study.
