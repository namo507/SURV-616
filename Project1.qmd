## Introduction

For this project, I aim to develop and evaluate a predictive model for coronary heart disease (CHD) using logistic regression. The analysis begins with a thorough preliminary exploration of the dataset, identifying key variables and their relationships with CHD. I then focus on selecting and transforming predictors to optimize the model's performance, carefully testing for nonlinearity and interactions. Once the final model is established, I assess its fit using statistical tests, residual analysis, and goodness-of-fit measures to ensure reliability. Predictive accuracy is evaluated through metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, supported by cross-validation for robustness. Finally, I interpret the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each predictor on CHD risk and identify the most important variables driving predictions. Overall, this comprehensive approach highlights age, family history, and tobacco use as critical factors in CHD prediction while providing actionable insights into the model's performance and limitations.

## Preliminary Analysis

Now, I began my preliminary analysis by examining the structure and summary statistics of the CHD dataset. I found that the dataset contains 420 observations and 10 variables, including both continuous predictors (such as sbp, tobacco, ldl, adiposity, typea, obesity, alcohol, and age) and categorical variables (famhist and chd). I checked for missing values and confirmed that there were none. After converting the variables famhist and chd into factors for appropriate analysis, I proceeded with univariate analysis by creating histograms to visualize the distribution of each continuous predictor. This helped me observe their shapes and identify any potential skewness or outliers.  

Next, I conducted bivariate analyses using boxplots to explore how each predictor varies according to CHD status. These plots provided initial insights into potential differences between groups. Additionally, I created empirical logit plots for each continuous predictor to visually assess their relationship with the likelihood of CHD. These empirical logit plots allowed me to detect potential linear or nonlinear relationships between predictors and CHD status. Finally, I generated a correlation matrix to check for multicollinearity among predictors and examined the relationship between family history (famhist) and CHD using a chi-square test. This comprehensive preliminary analysis provided me with a solid foundation to better understand the data structure, identify important variables, and guide further modeling efforts.


## Predictor Selection and Transformations

In the second part of my analysis, I began by performing univariate logistic regression models to assess the individual importance of each predictor. Variables such as age, tobacco usage, family history (famhist), adiposity, and LDL cholesterol emerged as particularly significant predictors based on their low p-values and lower AIC scores. 

Next, I checked for potential nonlinear relationships using quadratic terms for each continuous predictor. This analysis revealed significant nonlinear effects for tobacco and LDL cholesterol, suggesting these variables might benefit from transformations to better capture their relationships with CHD.  I then explored potential interactions between meaningful pairs of variables, such as age and tobacco use, systolic blood pressure (sbp) and obesity, LDL cholesterol and family history, and tobacco use with family history. 

However, none of these interactions turned out to be statistically significant in my analysis.  Finally, I built candidate logistic regression models incorporating these findings: a base model with all original predictors; a model including the squared age term (as an example transformation); and a model testing the interaction between tobacco and age. 

Comparing these candidate models using AIC values, I found that the base model without additional transformations or interactions provided the best fit (lowest AIC). This comprehensive approach allowed me to carefully evaluate the necessity of transformations and interactions, ultimately guiding me toward selecting an effective final model for predicting CHD status.


## Model Fit Assessment

The final model's fit to the data was assessed using several approaches. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) comparing the base model to models with transformed variables and interactions showed no significant improvement in fit, as indicated by p-values of 0.3122 and 0.901, respectively. This suggests that neither adding a quadratic term for age nor including an interaction between tobacco and age provided meaningful enhancement to the model's predictive power.

Additionally, the base model had the lowest AIC (448.7357) and BIC (489.1383) compared to the other models, further confirming it as the best-fitting model.  To evaluate residuals, I examined both Pearson residuals and a binned residual plot. The binned residual plot revealed that the average residuals were close to zero across predicted probabilities, indicating no systematic bias in the model's predictions. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test also supported this conclusion, with a high p-value of 0.9322, suggesting that the model adequately fits the observed data.

Overall, these assessments indicate that the final model provides a good fit to the data without requiring additional transformations or interactions. The residual analysis and goodness-of-fit tests further validate its reliability in predicting CHD status effectively.



## Predictive Accuracy Assessment 

To assess predictive accuracy, I calculated several metrics and used robust techniques to evaluate the model's performance. First, I computed the predicted probabilities for CHD using the final model and evaluated its discriminative ability with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.776, indicating good overall predictive accuracy. To determine the optimal threshold for classification, I used Youden's J statistic, which identified 0.29 as the cutpoint that balances sensitivity and specificity.  

Using this threshold, I created a confusion matrix, which revealed an accuracy of 69%, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 61%. While the model effectively identifies CHD cases (high sensitivity), it is less proficient at correctly classifying non-CHD cases (lower specificity). Precision was calculated at 53%, and the F1 score which is a harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity was 0.65, reflecting moderate performance in balancing false positives and false negatives.  

To further validate the model, I performed 5-fold cross-validation using a simplified formula with key predictors (age, tobacco, LDL, and famhist). This yielded consistent results across folds, with an average AUC of 0.776, accuracy of 65%, sensitivity of 77%, and specificity of 59%. These metrics confirm that the model generalizes well to new data. Additionally, a learning curve analysis showed stable performance as training set size increased, suggesting that adding more data might not significantly improve accuracy.  

Overall, the assessments that I demonstrated shows that the model performs reasonably well in predicting CHD status, with strong sensitivity but room for improvement in specificity and precision.



## Meaning of Coefficients

Ok so the coefficients in the logistic regression model represent the relationship between each predictor and the log odds of coronary heart disease (CHD). For example, the coefficient for age is 0.042, meaning that for every one-year increase in age, the log odds of CHD increase by 0.042. When converted to an odds ratio using $e^{\beta}$, this corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.043, indicating a 4.3\% increase in the odds of CHD per year of age. Similarly, tobacco has a coefficient of 0.086, translating to an odds ratio of 1.090, suggesting that each unit increase in tobacco consumption raises the odds of CHD by approximately 9\%.  

The variable LDL cholesterol has a coefficient of 0.184 and an odds ratio of 1.202, implying that higher LDL levels significantly increase the likelihood of CHD. Family history (famhist) is particularly impactful, with a coefficient of 0.948 and an odds ratio of 2.582, meaning individuals with a positive family history are over two and a half times more likely to develop CHD compared to those without.  On the other hand, systolic blood pressure (sbp) and obesity have coefficients close to zero (0.007 and -0.034, respectively), indicating weaker or non-significant associations with CHD in this model. For instance, obesity's negative coefficient suggests a slight protective effect, but its p-value (0.258) shows that this relationship is not statistically significant.  

Now to compare relative importance across predictors, standardized coefficients were calculated by scaling continuous variables to have mean zero and standard deviation one. This analysis revealed that age ($\beta=0.616$) and tobacco ($\beta=0.402$) are among the most influential predictors when adjusted for scale.  Finally, average marginal effects (AMEs) provided additional insights into how changes in predictors affect the probability of CHD directly. For example, age has an AME of 0.0073, meaning that each additional year increases the probability of CHD by approximately 0.73\%. 

Similarly, tobacco use increases CHD probability by about 1.48\% per unit increase.  These interpretations highlight both the magnitude and significance of predictors in influencing CHD risk, with family history emerging as a particularly strong factor alongside age and LDL cholesterol levels.



## Importance of Predictors

Based on the results, several predictors stand out as particularly important for predicting coronary heart disease (CHD). So using two approaches i.e. z-values from the model coefficients and AIC differences from reduced models, I identified age, family history (famhist), and tobacco use as the most influential variables.  The z-values rank famhist as the most significant predictor, with a z-value of 3.99, indicating that having a family history of CHD strongly increases the likelihood of developing the condition. 

This aligns with its high AIC difference (14.25), suggesting that removing famhist from the model would significantly reduce its predictive power. Similarly, age has a z-value of 3.94 and an AIC difference of 14.26, highlighting its critical role in predicting CHD risk, as older individuals are more likely to develop the disease. Tobacco use also emerges as important, with a z-value of 3.20 and an AIC difference of 9.11, reflecting its strong association with increased CHD risk.  

Other predictors, such as LDL cholesterol (ldl), systolic blood pressure (sbp), and obesity, appear less impactful based on both metrics. For instance, sbp and obesity have negative AIC differences (-0.35 and -0.70), suggesting that their removal might slightly improve the model's fit.  The partial dependence plots further illustrate the importance of these top predictors by showing how changes in age, tobacco use, and ldl influence the predicted probability of CHD. These visualizations confirm that increasing values for these predictors substantially raise CHD risk.
